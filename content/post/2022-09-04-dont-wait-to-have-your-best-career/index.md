description: "Advice to kick-starting your best career"

Are you feeling bored at work, stalled in your career progression, or ready for more than just a paycheck from your job?  Or maybe you're just starting your career and wondering if everybody else knows something about being successful that you don't.

Resignation, burnout and boomerang are all hot topics relating to careers in America recently, but I want to share an overlooked subject that I wish I had given more attention to when I started my career as an engineer over 20 years ago. 

It's not anything new or innovative.  In fact, it's rather dull which may be why it tends to get overlooked and under utilized.  It's the **Career Development Plan (CDP)**.  When this discussion came up at work, I heard groans and grumbles.  Yes, some of them were from me, but upon deeper reflection I realized there may be something useful underneath the bad wrap.  

<span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">I too was feeling the pangs of career dissatisfaction even though on paper I should feel successful</font></span>.  I then wondered what my problem is. I started pondering the meaning of life and discovered spiritual writings from authors like Echart Tolle and Tibetan Buddhist teachers like Sogyal Rinpoche.  Wait, don't leave yet.  I'm not going to suggest becoming a monk or giving up materialistic desires.  What I'm going to do though is suggest we meet somewhere in the middle to see if its possible to feel true happiness and success and earn a livable income.  

Through these spiritual readings I discovered that one of my biggest career flaws was that <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">I was trying to make a plan based on somebody else's version of success</span>. This explained my long held feelings of rudderlessness and that I had no compass for my life; like leaves scuffling down the road wherever the wind blew. <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">It left me with that "meh" feeling</span> that maybe I wasn't living up to my full potential.

I realized that what I needed to be doing was apply some focus to continuous self discovery and make more deliberate decisions from within, rather than pick choices from a menu that somebody else had assembled.  Although you may find numerous articles on developing a CDP, I am going to suggest a minor tweak, and that is starting with YOU.  

<span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">When <u>what</u> you are doing aligns with <u>who</u> you are, then your potential to have your best career is unleashed</span>.  Perhaps it's idealistic, but this is the world I want to live in.  I sincerely hope this perspective can help more people realize their best. 

## Putting It All Together

My version of the CDP is comprised of 2 major elements: The process and the plan.  

**The Process**:
The process starts with what defines success for YOU. You'll first understand and prioritize your values and then align them to lifelong goals (ex: end of career/retirement or end of life goals).  Next you'll break the big goals down into smaller, shorter-term goals that align to your current career opportunities, and then define actionable steps you can take right away.

**The Plan**:
The plan is just a list of goals and actions. The format can be whatever works for you.  It can be formally documented or as informal as a whiteboard or sticky notes.  The point is to make it work for you. 

## Get Started On Your Best Career
I like to think of a career as a journey which requires some tools.  The tutorial will help you to define your unique **compass**, understand the **landscape** and **map**, locate your **starting point**, **destination** and plan your **route**.

If you're starting to think this sounds like a lot of work.  You're correct.  But you get out what you put in.  <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">Success is not something that happens TO you, it's something you create for yourself</span>.  

Are plans bulletproof?  No.  But they'll help keep you progressing on a path that is meaningful, fulfilling and brings you joy and happiness.  Why not create your own luck?
