This post continues from the introduction which can be found here: [Don't Wait to Have Your Best Career](https://kljohnson.netlify.app/2022/09/04/dont-wait-to-have-your-best-career/).  It is tutorial that introductes a procedural methodology to create a career development plan that can help you obtain your version of a successful career or perhaps just understand what others might be doing to forge ahead.

The journey is comprised of these steps:

### Step 1: Build Your Compass (Know Thyself)
"<span style="background-color: DarkSlateGray"><font color="Gold"><em>Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom</em></font></span>" --Aristotle

Your journey should be guided by your values. Otherwise too many years later you could realize you've been wasting your time on the wrong things.  By using your values as a compass you are better poised to spend your precious time on this earth doing things that bring you fulfillment and joy. 

In this exercise, you'll spend some time coming up with a top 5 list of your values in priority order.  If you're having a difficult time coming up with these, then you're not alone.  Trus me, it's hard to figure out who you are and why you want what you want.  It's been a continual process for me for over 30 years!  You'll probably keep thinking about it and updating your list until you feel "just right" about it.  Some helpful tips to get started:
1. What experiences fulfill you, bring you joy and happiness?  
2. Who your role models and why?  What is it about them that you admire and seek to amplify in yourself?
3. Dig deeper into the WHY behind your current goals.  For example if you want to be rich, what is it about being rich that you really want?  Is it freedom, admiration, power, etc?

What values are behind the theme of your responses?  You may want to stop here and read more about values or even take an assessment to help you understand yourself and what motivates you.  If you already have a good handle on who you are, then go on to the next step.

<span class="content2" style="display:none">

### Step 2: Understand The Landscape
<p align="center" style="float: right; padding-right:10px">
  <img src="./resources/TOP.png" alt="drawing" style="width:300px;"/>
</p>

The landscape helps you see which routes will be easier and which will be more difficult to traverse.  The TOP model is popular and can easily be Googled to get more details.  TOP stands for: **Talent**, **Opportunity** and **Passion**.  The concept is that when the 3 intersect, this is where you can have your best career.  

Take a moment to think about your talents (i.e. strengths) and passions (things you have an affinity to do and would probably even do them for free).  If you're having trouble defining your talents, it may help to get feedback from your manager, mentor, colleagues or friends.  There are also assessments like [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/254033/strengthsfinder.aspx).

The opportunities available are going to be restricted by the company you work for, your boss and the particular team you're in. Talk to your manager or think about how to **Job Craft** your role in a way that can best overlap with your talents and passions. Align opportunities with business objectives for maximum impact. 

Don't forget that the landscape is not static!  Adopt a **growth mindset**, to believe that anything is possible.

### Step 3: Map Orientation
The Map is also going to be shaped by your company and the particular team you're in.  This defines the path to upward mobility and should define required expectations. 
<p align="center" style="float: right; padding-right:10px">

</p>
 For example a company may have grade levels (ex: Engineer grade level I, II, III) or may simply use titles like "junior", "senior", "lead", "fellow", etc.  Each typically come with financial and/or prestige related incentives and will likely be how you end up defining progress.  
 
 Having a discussion with your manager, mentor or colleagues may be helpful to make sure you understand what it *actually* takes to move around.

<!--- (Yes, sometimes the expectations are not fair and it can feel like people around you are moving faster than you are while you continue to work harder and harder.  This is another good reason to take a pause and re-evaluation your situation)--->

<!--- #################### STEP 4 ########################### --->
</span>
<span class="content4" style="display:none">

### Step 4: Choose Your Destination

It's *Choose You're Own Adventure* time.  How far you want to go on the map? :-)
<br/>
Start with a long-term goal which may be a goal 10+ years down the line, when you retire, or even what you want before you die.  Be aspirational (i.e. the goal might feel impossible right now) but remember to connect your goals to your values.  Do they align?  Why do you want this particular goal?  Note that not every goal is achieved through leveling up or being promoted.

Now break the larger goals into smaller goals until you identify something that is achievable in the next 1-4 years.

<font size=3 color="Gray">

example:

* **Life Goal**: Become the best version of myself so that I can inspire others to be the best version of themselves
* **Career Goal**: Promotion every 3-5 years and/or I successfully inspire others.
* **Next Destination**: Promotion within 2 years

<!--- #################### STEP 5 ########################### --->
</span>
<span class="content5" style="display:none">

### Step 5: Locate Your Starting Point On The Map

Your strengths define your starting point.  Locate them on the map, i.e. which grade level or title are you performing to?  I suggest you have a meaningful conversation with your manager to ensure you are on the same page because they will be your gatekeeper to upwards mobility in your company.

<!--- #################### STEP 6 ########################### --->
</span>
<span class="content6" style="display:none">

### Step 6: Plan Your Route

Now that you have a destination in mind and know where you're starting from, it's time to plan the route  and waypoints.  Think of the waypoints as micro-goals (or stepping stones) along your way to achieving your goals.  It's best if they are specific, time bound and measurable.  What do you want, by when, as measured by what?  Without those details, it becomes too easy to let yourself off the hook.  For example, of you want to become an an *expert* in python coding, what does it mean to be an expert?  Instead, define expert as for example, passing a particular skills test (like LinkedIn skills tests).

<font size=3 color="Gray">

example:

* **Next Destination**: Promoted in next 2 years
    * **Waypoint 1**:Become an expert at programming in python by the end of the year, as measured by passing the Linked-In skills test
    * **Waypoint 2**: Become a confident presenter

</font>

</font>
</span>

<!--- #################### STEP 7 ########################### --->
</span>
<span class="content7" style="display:none">

### Step 7: Get Moving

Break the waypoints into small, actionable steps.  Again suppose so you want to be an expert python coder.  How does one achieve that?  Brainstorm a list of options such as taking a class or reading a book.  Prioritize the list then go find that specific class or book, schedule some time in whatever calendar runs your life and go do it!

<font size=3 color="Gray">

example:

* **Next Destination**: Promoted in next 2 years
    * **Waypoint 1**:Become an expert at programming in python by the end of the year, as measured by passing the Linked-In skills test
    <font size=3 color="Black">
        * **Action 1**: Schedule 2 hours per week on my calendar to find a class and complete all the exercises
    </font>
    * **Waypoint 2**: Become a confident presenter
    <font size=3 color="Black">
        * **Action 2**: Schedule an hour a week to attend my local Toastmasters club meeting
    </font>
