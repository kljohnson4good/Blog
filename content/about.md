# About Me

<font size = 5>
Kristi Johnson
</font>
<br/>
Data Scientist, Programmer, Engineer, Manager, Mentor, Dog Mom
<br/>
Born/Live: California, USA
<br/>
<br/>

I have have been an engineer for over 20 years, starting with my first internship in 1997 during college where I learned to love software automation, drawing histograms and applying visualizations, math and statistics to manufacturing and test challenges.  

After graduating with a B.S in **Computer Engineering**, my professional roles required software development and hardware debug to deliver a product, but I continued to be drawn to using data and visualizations to excel at debug and problem solving.  Finally in 2017 I decided to return to academics to take my education to the next level and graduated from [**Pennsylvania State University** online Master's degree program](https://bulletins.psu.edu/graduate/programs/majors/statistics/) in 2020.

I consider myself to be multi-faceted in most aspects of my life, hardly settling on being an expert at one thing.  For example, my college athletic interests consisted of 8 **track-and-field** events (7 events for the Heptathlon + triple jump) during the Spring, and playing multiple positions on the **soccer** field (including goalie) during the Fall.  

Applied to my career, my multi-dimensional interests have enabled me to go deep as a software developer, as well as exercise leadership by achieving big goals through the coordination of team efforts.  My wide focus helps me to see interdependencies and bring cross-functional teams together synergystically to solve problems.

Another driving influence came from a lesson I learned from my two Boy Scout cousins that I grew up with (both eventually earning Eagle Scout).  Always, always **leave things in a better state than when I arrived**.  That lesson became deeply embedded into my values and part of my work ethic.  No matter what role I'm playing or task I'm working on, I strive to automate, document or some how improve it before I move on.  This applies to myself as well.  I continue to keep my mind open and work on being a better version of myself with each passing year.

My passion for **teamwork and coaching** came from being lucky enough to have had generous, talented and caring coaches in my athletic endeavers.  In turn they have instilled in me a desire to pay that forward as a coach or mentor to others.  During my time as a competitive athlete, I also struggled with the **mental health** side of the game, and understand how critical that part is to performing and achieving success.  I've carried those lessons with me and aspire to lead a balanced life, working hard to (metaphorically) climb mountains, but also taking time to experience joy, restore energy levels and overall not take everything too seriously. 

I am a hard core **introvert** and my #1 strengh according to my [strength assessment](https://www.viacharacter.org/) is **Humility**.  As an athlete I pretty much had to be dragged onto an awards podium and I hated pictures (good thing nobody had cell phones in those days!).  Even holding eye contact with other people can feel uncomfortable.  Growing up, these traits can feel like weaknesses, but over time I am learning how to turn them into strengths.  For example, I don't pretend to have all the answers, and I love learning and sharing the stage with others and seeing them rise above their own limiting beliefs.

Because of those traits, I never planned on becoming a manager. But when the opportunity presented itself in 2019, I leaned into the culmination of my experiences to say yes.  It was challenging but I poured my attention and focus into learning as much as possible. This cultivated a passion for helping others with **career development**, with a mission to create a rewarding and fulfilling work experience that is balanced with life's demands.

### Terrifying but Worthy Experiences

As an introvert, starting these experiences were terrifying.  However looking back I couldn't be more thankful because I am a better person for doing them.  I'm a big believer in building courage through confrontation of fear.

1. **[Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/)** (any public speaking)
2. Leading **Volunteer** events (thanks Folsom Excellence & United Way!)
3. **Martial Arts** (sparring, black belt test and teaching)
4. Becoming a **manager** for the first time
5. Going back-to-school as a 38-year-old **student**
6. Sky diving, scuba diving, waterfall repelling (ascentionism), ...

Top experiences that have shaped me include:

2. The adrenaline rush of a product "**Power-On**" and getting things to work under schedule pressure.
3. Achieving audacious goals through coordination of many people working together as a **team**
4. Company and Team celebrations where lifelong **friendships** are made

# Site Development

**<u>How this site is created</u>**
<br/>
This site is built using R language blogdown package and hosted from Netlify connected to my github source code.  I used the default theme that came by following the bookdown tutorial and then leveraged some bits from ccdportfolio's 'minimal' theme to add category and tag links on the home page above the blog title.  I like the concept to include those to assist users to find content they are looking for if the number of blog titles continue to increase.
