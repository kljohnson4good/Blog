This site was inspired by the ASA Committee on Career Development [Portfolio Project](https://ccdportfolio.netlify.app) written in Amstat news June 2022.  Source code and method follows the fantastic tutorial [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill (2022-08-08).

**<u>How this site is created</u>**
<br/>
This site is built using R language blogdown package and hosted from Netlify connected to my github source code.  I used the default theme that came by following the bookdown tutorial and then leveraged some bits from ccdportfolio's 'minimal' theme to add category and tag links on the home page above the blog title.  I like the concept to include those to assist users to find content they are looking for if the number of blog titles continue to increase.
