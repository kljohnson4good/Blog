      <description>BackgroundThis post was created from a 2021 Pennsylvania State University (PSU) Stat 485 class project as a way for students to learn R and associated RStudio IDE. Iâ€™ve copied the code as I created it during the class and re-hosted the app in a new location given that I am no longer a student.
This tutorial will review the source code which generates the Shiny App as demonstrated below.</description>
