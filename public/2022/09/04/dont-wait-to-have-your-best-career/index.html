      <p>Are you feeling bored at work, stalled in your career progression, or ready for more than just a paycheck from your job?  Or maybe you&rsquo;re just starting your career and wondering if everybody else knows something about being successful that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Resignation, burnout and boomerang are all hot topics relating to careers in America recently, but I want to share an overlooked subject that I wish I had given more attention to when I started my career as an engineer over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anything new or innovative.  In fact, it&rsquo;s rather dull which may be why it tends to get overlooked and under utilized.  It&rsquo;s the <strong>Career Development Plan (CDP)</strong>.  When this discussion came up at work, I heard groans and grumbles.  Yes, some of them were from me, but upon deeper reflection I realized there may be something useful underneath the bad wrap.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">I too was feeling the pangs of career dissatisfaction even though on paper I should feel successful</font></span>.  I then wondered what my problem is. I started pondering the meaning of life and discovered spiritual writings from authors like Echart Tolle and Tibetan Buddhist teachers like Sogyal Rinpoche.  Wait, don&rsquo;t leave yet.  I&rsquo;m not going to suggest becoming a monk or giving up materialistic desires.  What I&rsquo;m going to do though is suggest we meet somewhere in the middle to see if its possible to feel true happiness and success and earn a livable income.</p>
<p>Through these spiritual readings I discovered that one of my biggest career flaws was that <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">I was trying to make a plan based on somebody else&rsquo;s version of success</span>. This explained my long held feelings of rudderlessness and that I had no compass for my life; like leaves scuffling down the road wherever the wind blew. <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">It left me with that &ldquo;meh&rdquo; feeling</span> that maybe I wasn&rsquo;t living up to my full potential.</p>
<p>I realized that what I needed to be doing was apply some focus to continuous self discovery and make more deliberate decisions from within, rather than pick choices from a menu that somebody else had assembled.  Although you may find numerous articles on developing a CDP, I am going to suggest a minor tweak, and that is starting with YOU.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">When <u>what</u> you are doing aligns with <u>who</u> you are, then your potential to have your best career is unleashed</span>.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s idealistic, but this is the world I want to live in.  I sincerely hope this perspective can help more people realize their best.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>My version of the CDP is comprised of 2 major elements: The process and the plan.</p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong>:
The process starts with what defines success for YOU. You&rsquo;ll first understand and prioritize your values and then align them to lifelong goals (ex: end of career/retirement or end of life goals).  Next you&rsquo;ll break the big goals down into smaller, shorter-term goals that align to your current career opportunities, and then define actionable steps you can take right away.</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong>:
The plan is just a list of goals and actions. The format can be whatever works for you.  It can be formally documented or as informal as a whiteboard or sticky notes.  The point is to make it work for you.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-on-your-best-career">Get Started On Your Best Career</h2>
<p>I like to think of a career as a journey which requires some tools.  The tutorial will help you to define your unique <strong>compass</strong>, understand the <strong>landscape</strong> and <strong>map</strong>, locate your <strong>starting point</strong>, <strong>destination</strong> and plan your <strong>route</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re starting to think this sounds like a lot of work.  You&rsquo;re correct.  But you get out what you put in.  <span style="background-color: Beige"><font size="4" color="Black">Success is not something that happens TO you, it&rsquo;s something you create for yourself</span>.</p>
<p>Are plans bulletproof?  No.  But they&rsquo;ll help keep you progressing on a path that is meaningful, fulfilling and brings you joy and happiness.  Why not create your own luck?</p>
